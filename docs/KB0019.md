# # KB0019 - Generate a report of all on-demand backup executed on a time period.

## Command:
 ```$ rbkcli report on_demand backup```

## Definition:
 - This command will query the /event API event for all backup events, if it finds that the Backup was a on-demand backup, it gets more information about the event, such as which user initiated and details about the object being backed up.

## Usage:
0. Requirements:

	a. In order to run this command, the user needs to have the following branch of rbkcli installed: ```backup_on_demand_report```
	- Download and install the mentioned branch by running the following commands: 
	    ```
	    $ git clone --single-branch --branch backup_on_demand_report https://github.com/rubrikinc/rbkcli.git
	    $ cd rbkcli
	    $ pip install .
	    ```
	b. The user needs to be authenticated in the Cluster by following the [Quick Start Guide](quick-start.md)

1. Parameters:

	a. The available parameters that alter which events will be gathered are:
	- **batch_size**: Amount of events to retrieve in each batch (for each API call issued to the cluster), default is 1000, maximum is 9999. This parameter **is not** required
	- **after_date**: Start date which the event will be fetched, the eldest event gathered will be from this date. This parameter **is** required
	- **before_date**: End date which the event will be fetched, the most recent event will be from this date, default is today, 15 min ago. This parameter **is not** required
	- **after_date**: Path of the file which the output will be written. This parameter **is** required
	PS.: Dates have to be in the following format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ, like in the example bellow.

2. Example:

    a. Following is a valid examples of how to run the `report on_demand backup` command:
    ```
    $ rbkcli report on_demand backup --parameter after_date=2020-04-06T12:00:00Z,out_file=/tmp/on_demand_backup.json,batch_size=100
    [=========================================================================================___________] 89.3449%
    ```
    b. As you can see the command returns a progress bar that moves according to the coverage of the time frame specified.
    ```
    [=========================================================================================___________] 89.3449%
    ```
    c. Once that is done the command will return a small summary:
    ```
    [====================================================================================================] 100.0000%]
    {
      "status": "Completed successfully.",
      "json_report": "/tmp/on_demand_backup.json"
    }
    ```
    d. To see what was the actual result, the user will need to read the generated file, in this case `/tmp/on_demand_backup.json`:
    ```
    $ less /tmp/on_demand_backup.json
    ```
3. Reporting:
    
    a. The reporting is done by using ```rbkcli jsonfy```, for this report we suggest running jsonfy with the following key selection and `-T` at the end to convert into a table:
    ```
    $ rbkcli jsonfy -p-parameter file=/tmp/on_demand_backup.json -s objectName,objectType,location,time,username,eventStatus,isOnDemand -T
	 objectName         | objectType   | location                    | time                         | username     | eventStatus | isOnDemand
	==========================================================================================================================================
	 vishak_smb         | ShareFileset | \\10.35.38.64\lab           | Fri Apr 10 11:22:01 UTC 2020 | vishak.menon | Success     | True
	 AdventureWorks2014 | Mssql        | lfk-sql14-sa-00\MSSQLSERVER | Thu Apr 09 06:36:18 UTC 2020 | bhagya       | Success     | True

	**Total amount of objects [2]

    ```
    b. If a HTML table is preferred, just replace the `-T` for `-H` and redirect the output to a html file:
    ```
    $ rbkcli jsonfy -p-parameter file=/tmp/on_demand_backup.json -s objectName,objectType,location,time,username,eventStatus,isOnDemand -H > /tmp/on_demand_backup.html 
    ```
